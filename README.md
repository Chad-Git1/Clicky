Clicky is easy to use:

1 open the app, 
2 enter a time interval x, 
3 click start clicking!

And now after every x amount of time, your computer will perform a left mouse click.
Just leave your pointer at a desired location on the screen to have it click as you wish.

By default Clicky will click every 4 minutes and 50 seconds if a time is not specified.
